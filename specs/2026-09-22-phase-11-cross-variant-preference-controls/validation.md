## 2. Automated Test Suite

- `tests/Feature/CrossVariantMotionTest.php`: Public-route motion-hook coverage, one-runtime guard, and reduced-motion/no-JS contracts for AC-1 through AC-3.
- `tests/Feature/ResponsiveNavigationTest.php`: Hero label removal, mobile navigation semantics, active state, and touch-target markup for AC-4 through AC-6.
- `tests/Feature/VisualPreferenceTest.php`: Palette/typeface defaults, valid/invalid query handling, session persistence, root attributes, and path/query preservation for AC-7 through AC-9.
- Existing multi-page, variant-resolution, testimonial, and consultation-form suites: rerun as regression coverage.

### Group 3 Review Remediation — 2026-09-22

- Removed the decorative `Calm editorial foundation` page-header badge from every Variant B non-home page while preserving chapter labels and page headings.
- Reworked the narrow-screen variant switcher into compact 44px A/B controls, retaining descriptive accessible labels and full labels at `sm` and above.

### Group 4 Automated Evidence — 2026-09-22

- Added four structured palette records, two structured typeface records, safe query/session/default resolution, and root `data-palette` / `data-typeface` attributes.
- Added a normal-link, mobile-collapsible preference disclosure that preserves the path, variant, selected preference, and unrelated query values.
- Added `Newsreader` (400/500/600 normal and italic) and `Manrope` (400/500/600/700) to the Vite font bundle; no Cormorant font was added.

### Independent QA Remediation — 2026-09-22

- QA-F1 (AC-7): Kept muted color tokens available for decorative use but centrally maps rendered `text-stone-warm-500` utilities to the compliant secondary-text token. Added four-palette contrast assertions; all supplied secondary-text/background pairs meet WCAG AA.
- QA-F2 (AC-6): Added a responsive-navigation initializer that closes the native mobile disclosure when the `lg` breakpoint is reached, preserving the no-JavaScript disclosure behavior. Added a regression assertion for the breakpoint reset contract.
- Strengthened preference coverage to prove valid query values override existing session preferences.
- `php artisan test --compact`: PASS — 90 tests, 1,775 assertions.
- `npm run build`, `npm run check:line-counts`, `vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent`, and `git diff --check`: PASS.
- Playwright Chromium visual checks: PASS at 1440×900 for Variant B About with Porcelain/Newsreader and 375×812 for Variant B Contact with Mineral/Newsreader, after motion settled.
- Fresh targeted independent QA for QA-F1 and QA-F2 is pending.

## 3. Manual Verification Checklist

1. Slowly scroll every route in both variants at desktop and mobile sizes; compare each sequence to its landing-page language and confirm once-only settling.
2. Emulate reduced motion and disable JavaScript; confirm immediate content/navigation visibility, no delayed or hidden controls, and no looping effects.
3. At 320px and 375px, open/close the primary menu with keyboard and touch, visit every primary link, use its contact CTA, and confirm no clipped header or fixed preference control.
4. Check services, team details, reviews/modal, contact form/map, FAQ, legal pages, and footer at tablet and desktop for overflow, focus visibility, and readable hierarchy.
5. Select all four palettes and both typography choices in both variants; confirm route/query persistence, selected-state clarity, readable contrast, no gradients, and stable layout.
